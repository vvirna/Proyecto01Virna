# Proyecto01Virna
# My first project for ACAMICA's data science course
We were asked to work with a  Properati dataset of properties in Capital Federal
and Gran Buenos Aires, here in Argentina.
The goal was to create a ML model that predicts the price of the properties.
I did an exploratory data analysis, with graphics.
I created a LinearRegressor bemchmark, I evaluated it
and then I created to simple models: DecisionTreeRegrssor and KNNRegressor
evaluated them and finally wrote some conclusions.
