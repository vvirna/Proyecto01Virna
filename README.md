# Proyecto01Virna
#My first project for ACAMICA's data science course
#We were asked to work with a  Properati dataset of properties in Capital Federal
#and Gran Buenos Aires, here in Argentina.
#I did an exploratory data analysis, with graphics
#Finally I created a LinearRegressor bemchmark, I evaluated it
#and then I created to simple models: DecisionTreeRegrssor and KNNRegressor
#evaluated them and finally wrote some conclusions
